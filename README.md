# Mixins for Java

This is the code that goes with this blog post: http://blog.berniesumption.com/software/mixins-for-java/

The folder mixin-test is an eclipse project. To run the tests,
import the project into eclipse and run the runner classes in
the com.berniecode.mixin4j.test.* packages.

Yeah yeah I know, this should be a maven project. Sorry :o)
